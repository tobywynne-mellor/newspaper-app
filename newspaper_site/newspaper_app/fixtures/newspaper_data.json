Development Framework", "content": "<div><p>Front-end development is constantly evolving owing to the technologies and programming languages.</p> <p>Today, when there's a plethora of applications available Reactjs is one prominent name in the web app market. It is basically a JavaScript library that you can label as one of the best frameworks to develop web apps. It won a huge popularity thanks to Facebook who maintains it together with the developer community. Many leading companies such as Apple, PayPal, Netflix, Dropbox use ReactJS owing to its simplicity, consistency, and UI. If considering the stats, over 2,20,000 websites are built using React JS framework.</p><p>The framework got no chill!</p><p>It might be having a lot of benefits, don't you think so?</p><p>Well, it does and thus, in this article, we will talk about the top seven reasons to use React JS for your frontend development.</p><p>Let's begin!</p><p></p><ol>\r\n<li>\r\n<strong>Easy to learn</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nReactJS is much easier to learn when you compare it with other popular frontend frameworks like Angular &amp; Vue. It's actually one of the main reasons React gained so much attraction in a very short time. Using it companies can provide react js development services and develop their projects quickly.<p></p><p></p><ol>\r\n<li value=\"2\">\r\n<strong>Rich User Interface</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nQuality of user interface also plays an important role. A high quality UI app has better chances of gaining popularity. When it comes to ReactJS, it contains declarative components that help in building high-quality, rich user interfaces, reason why businesses using reactjs development services are always on the profit end.<p></p><p></p><ol>\r\n<li value=\"3\">\r\n<strong>Custom Components</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nReact comes with JSX, an optional syntax extension that allows you to write custom components for any react js development company, create high-volume applications, and turn HTML mockups into React Element trees.<p></p><p>These components essentially support HTML quoting, and also make all subcomponents a delightful developer experience for the web app you develop.</p><p></p><ol>\r\n<li value=\"4\">\r\n<strong>Fast Rendering</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhen you start working on this project, it's better to pre-define the structure while developing a complex app as a react js development company. ReactJS uses a DOM model, a tree structure in which any changes made at higher level will not impact the user interface of the application. You can easily test each module and modify it without affecting another section.<p></p><p></p><ol>\r\n<li value=\"5\">\r\n<strong>SEO- Friendly</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhen you compare it with other platforms, Reach JS helps in reducing the page load time of your web app. And eventually that helps you in getting high rankings on search engines.<p></p><p></p><ol>\r\n<li value=\"6\">\r\n<strong>Developer Toolset</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThe developer toolset is to facilitate developers with technology learning and help them differentiate components, observe component hierarchies, ReactJS framework provides React dev tools and Chrome dev tools.<p></p><p></p><ol>\r\n<li value=\"7\">\r\n<strong>Community Support</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nA huge number of individual React JS developers are contributing towards the ReactJS community and making it a fantastic frontend framework. Currently, ReactJS attained 136,079 stars on Github and 1,331 regular contributors. For any kind of support, you can post your queries here in the community and get help.<p></p><p>Apart from this, ReactJS has many benefits that makes it a huge success in the development market.</p><p>Infact, the latest version of React, i.e. React version 16.13.0 has come up with more advanced features such as concurrent mode, suspense, component stack in hydration warning, and many other minor updates, in order to provide developers with better performance. So, if you want to build a successful web app using React then you can contact a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.biztechcs.com/reactjs-development/\">ReactJS Development</a> Company and hire react js developer..</p><p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p><p>Considering the benefits of ReactJS, we can sum up that the idea of this quality framework is to build large scale applications with timely data updation. Apart from this, there are other reasons to go for ReactJS development services - Virtual DOM, interactive UIs, JSX support, component-based structure and much more.</p><p>So what are you waiting for?</p><p>Hire ReactJS Developer today!</p>\t\t\t</div>", "author": "Maulik D Shah", "date": "2020-08-24", "category": 1}}, {"model": "newspaper_app.article", "pk": 2, "fields": {"title": "The Big 'Lies' About Our Economic Prospects", "content": "<div><p>In the spring of 2007 I hosted a conference for a group of insurance professionals. One of the most popular speakers was my old friend the economist Roger Martin-Fagg. He was his usual entertaining self, but took everyone by surprise by suggesting that the world economy was on the brink of a meltdown the like of which we had never seen before, and it was going to happen soon - probably within 12 months. Yes, he predicted the financial crash of 2008 a year before it actually happened.</p><p>Now in Spring 2007 the world economy was doing very nicely thank you. Following three consecutive years of good growth, averaging 3.8% it was expected to fall only slightly in 2007 to 3.6%. Meanwhile the UK was doing pretty well too. House prices had risen from an average of £150,633 in January 2005 to £184,330 in May 2007 - a rise of 22.4%, whilst wages grew by an average of over 5% per annum between 2004 and 2007. Inflation on the other hand was under control and only rose by an average of 3.25% in the same period. Furthermore, between 2003 and 2007 the FTSE All Share Index grew by 49%, so overall everyone was feeling pretty optimistic about the prospects for the future. No one, other than Roger was saying anything about a recession, never mind a full blown crash!</p><p>So, when Roger issued his dire warning, the overwhelming response was to laugh it off - in the same way that we would laugh at a soothsayer predicting the end of the world. Eccentric yes, and likely to happen eventually, just not anytime soon.</p><p>You can imagine that those of us who were there in 2007 are far less likely to write off Roger's opinions now than we would have done previously.</p><p>I was therefore pleasantly surprised, and heartened to receive his latest Economic update, penned on 16 June. Once again he is at odds with the mainstream view, and indeed is critical of others talking world economic prospects down. He opens his piece by saying that the press is being irresponsible in the way it is reporting our economic outlook. His opening paragraph reads:</p><p>\"Last weekend the Daily Telegraph had a banner headline: 'Britain's biggest ever collapse in GDP wipes out 18 years of growth'. This statement is completely wrong. I am concerned that individuals who are trying to make the right judgement call are being fed this nonsense. To be clear: 18 years ago our GDP was £1 trillion. It is now £2.2 trillion. The reduction in spending in April was 20% on the previous April. The monthly flow of spending averages £200bn. 20% of that is £40bn. The media, as we know, impact emotion and decision taking. That Telegraph article is therefore both economically illiterate and irresponsible.\"</p><p>Wow! Hard hitting stuff. And the perpetuation of such comments is still evident a week later. In the Sunday Times on 21 June Sajid Javid is quoted as saying:</p><p>\"We've seen a 25% fall in GDP in two months. To put that in some perspective, that is 18 years of growth wiped out in two months.\"</p><p>And that's from our erstwhile Chancellor of the Exchequer, who should be anything but economically illiterate!</p><p>In his update Roger goes on to suggest that, despite what the world and his wife are saying, we are not going to have a recession. Indeed, whilst he acknowledges that quarter 2 of 2020 will be significantly negative, he expects quarter 3 to be significantly positive, and predicts that the UK economy could grow by 8.5% in 2021, with the World economy back to 2.5% growth next year too.</p><p>His argument is that the fundamentals for a recession don't exist in the same way as they did for previous recessions; rising prices and interest rates squeezing individuals and companies alike in 1979 and 1989, and banks stopping lending in 2008. The common factor is a shortage of money available, and that's not the case this time around. Households have seen a reduction in income, but a larger fall in what they've spent, and the UK Government is spending an extra £40bn a month pumping new money into the system, so no shortage here. Roger predicts a mini boom to take off in the next few months as a result of this excess cash in the system, with the only thing that could dampen it being the media reporting company closures, an increase in the R well above 1, and stories of mass redundancies.</p><p>I don't propose to reproduce all Roger's arguments here - you can read the whole article at https://www.ellisbates.com/news/june-2020-economic-update/ to get the complete picture, but I would say his reasoning and logic are very persuasive. And I for one would not bet against him. I also fully endorse his condemnation of sensationalist reporting in the media. They have to take more responsibility for the message they send out as, rightly or wrongly, people do listen to them. A more even handed and less melodramatic approach to reporting would benefit us all.

Choosing the Best Opt", "content": "<div><p>These days, it's hard to argue with the fact that the quality and functionality of an application also directly affect the economic growth of your enterprise. Depending on your business needs, you can create an application with monolithic or microservices architecture. The monolithic architecture used to be favored, but in recent years many companies are switching to microservices. Let's try to figure out why this is happening and weigh the benefits and drawbacks of both approaches.</p><p>The essence of both architectures</p><p>When working on applications, each developer deals with architectural specifics. In previous generations, most software companies designed purely monolithic applications. \"Monolith\" in any professional field means something presented as one piece, which makes sense for applications as well. Thus, a monolithic application is a single-tier, self-contained, and independent of other computing applications software. It combines the user interface and data access code into a single program on a separate platform and works as one indivisible unit.</p><p>Concerning microservices, the app structure is more complex. Here, the application looks like a collection of small, isolated units that run each process as a separate service. All the services perform their particular functions, have their own logic and database.</p><p>Monolithic vs microservices: which one is better?</p><p>Monolithic vs microservices? Many loudly declare: monolithic applications are a thing of the past. However, they still have advantages to consider before deciding on application architecture.</p><p>First, monolithic applications are easy to develop because any engineering team obviously has many years of experience building these traditional applications. Second, they're simple to deploy as you only need to handle one file and copy the application to a server. Finally, end-to-end testing and bug fixing are much faster, too.</p><p>Why is this approach losing its supporters? Probably, due to the difficulty of scaling. If one function fails, the entire application will crash leaving the customers highly dissatisfied. If you plan an update to the system, be ready to redeploy the application. Another possible scenario is when demand for one particular feature grows, developers have to increase resource limits for the entire application, not just for one specific feature.</p><p>A reasonable solution to these problems would be a transition to a microservice architecture. Since this kind of architecture implies isolated and independent features that run on their own containers, any of them can be scaled and updated without affecting the whole application.</p><p>Microservices architecture is also easier to understand because the developers can split up the app into smaller components and work on them separately. Your business goals determine which features are essential, and the engineering team pays close attention while designing them.</p><p>The microservices architecture is not deprived of drawbacks either. As a distributed system, all the services have to be deployed separately. The developers have to choose how to connect autonomous modules and databases and handle the process carefully.</p><p>Even though microservices give freedom to try different technologies and innovations inside the app, it's still important not to overdo here. A piece of advice: keep the application under strict control and implement standardized approaches, languages, and design. These actions will allow you to maintain the integrity of your application and grow the stream of customers.</p><p>Moving to microservices</p><p>Modern requirements, growing user flow, and a strive for innovation have led to a massive shift from traditional monolithic application methods to microservices architecture design. The changes have already been adopted by both small firms and large companies. Netflix, Uber, Amazon, SoundCloud, and Spotify are just a few of them. Netflix, for instance, was at the forefront of the early microservices architecture adopters.</p><p>Despite the widespread opinion that monolithic architecture is dying and microservices are a must-have for every company, we strongly recommend that you do research and carefully evaluate each type of architecture. If you have a small team, your business is a startup, and you want to launch your application faster, a monolithic architecture may be enough to achieve your business goals.</p><p>To implement microservices, you need several teams of competent experts who can create a large application with numerous modules and functions. With enough resources and a detailed plan, you can upgrade to a microservices architecture.</p><p>Now you have more information at your disposal to decide where you stand in the ongoing <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pixelplex.io/blog/monolithic-vs-microservices/\">monolithic vs microservices</a> dilemma.</p>\t\t\t</div>", "author": "Alexei Dulub", "date": "2020-10-29", "category": 1}}, {"model": "newspaper_app.article", "pk": 4, "fields": {"title": "How to Utilise Blockchain Technology for E-Commerc", "content": "<div><p><strong>What is Blockchain Technology?</strong></p><p>Blockchain is a decentralised digital public ledger for tracking economic transactions. It's designed to record not only financial transactions but everything that goes in it. The best feature of a Blockchain is that it allows to view user's holdings and the transactions that they have carried out over the system publicly.</p><p>Moreover, it also conceals the identity of a user via powerful cryptography. The decryption of the cryptographic code needs a long and challenging calculation, thereby, making it the safest way to transact money.</p><p><strong>Challenges in the e-commerce Sector</strong></p><p>Blockchain technology is transforming the ecommerce industry by decentralizing the control and cutting the existence of middleman from the landscape. But, before exploring the potential of Blockchain technology for e-commerce industry, let's dig into the current challenges that the e-commerce industry is facing.</p><p></p><ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<strong>High Costs- </strong>One of the major pain point of a seller in the traditional ecommerce business model is the involvement of a middleman, who takes away a good share of money on every purchase. The seller has to pay the transaction processing fee for completion of each transaction.</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<strong>Uncertain Security-</strong> Protection of buyers' data is another key concern for these kind of businesses. The system needs to gain the trust of their customers and have to assure them that their personal and financial data is safe. The current state of the ecommerce industry fails to provide foolproof security to the users.</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<strong>Time consuming-</strong> E-commerce model include an array of operations like supply chain, logistics, payment gateways etc. To manage all these operations e-commerce industry has to deal with this intermediates everyday. This consumes a lot of time to complete the whole process.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>How Blockchain will Drive the e-commerce Industry in Future</strong><p></p><p>Blockchain technology for e-commerce is a boom for not only the sellers but also for the buyers. Few of the challenges which can be addresses by introducing Blockchain in e-commerce industry are as follows:</p><p></p><ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<strong>Cost Reduction- </strong> With Blockchain, e-commerce industry can rely on the Blockchain technology for managing inventory, payment processing, product database and other business activities. This results in spending less on maintaining systems or hiring IT support teams to maintain them. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ripple etc. will cut-down the fees that third party institutions like banks charge during transactions.</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<strong>Cyber Threats- </strong> Despite of using a secure transaction network, the e-commerce industry is always at a risk of losing their customers data and money due to unwanted cyber attacks. Blockchain technology is a perfect solution for resolving these challenges. It provides highest level of security by using distributed ledgers for managing the e-commerce database management systems.</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<strong>Fast processing- </strong>Blockchain technology for e-commerce is removing the dependency of middleman, manpower and third party organizations from the e-commerce model. It saves a lot of time consumed in the overall process ranging from inventory managing, to order placing to delivering at users door step.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Conclusion</strong><p></p><p>These challenges have been bothering the sellers since the beginning. Thus, integrating Blockchain Technology to e-commerce sector can definitely be a good idea for the whole system. Here comes the need of Blockchain technology for e-commerce industry which is capable of resolving all the challenges alone.</p><p>Many e-commerce companies have already started investing in Blockchain technology to run their business smoothly.

The conditions, i.e. amount, interest and investment time are contractually agreed on beforehand. After the agreed time span has elapsed, the amount invested and the interest will be paid to the customer's reference account. That is why you refer to this type of investment as a time deposit. A condition of any fixed-term deposit contract is that you cannot access the deposit during the investment period.</p><p>The interest rate on the fixed deposit depends on the situation of the interest market during the conclusion of the contract, the duration of the deposit and of course the amount invested. If the time deposit is not properly cancelled by the deadline which is specified in the contract, the provider will usually automatically renew it at the current interest rate of the previously agreed period. Before the contract is concluded, however, it can also be agreed that the sum will be transferred to a reference account after the time deposit expires.\r\n<br>Security is what makes fixed-term deposits so attractive to investors.

The steady growth of the invested capital is guaranteed.</p><p><b>The deposit period</b></p><p>The periods differ greatly from provider to provider and vary from a few months to several years. The higher the fixed duration of the fixed deposit investment, the higher will be the investment interest rate. Fixed-term deposits are particularly useful when short-term funds are available which can be Invested.</p><p>A medium-term contract should be in most cases the smartest decision for the optimal investment duration since the interest rates can change. Which means it can be profitable for you to invest the money again after the term deposit period has expired under better conditions. Depending on the interest rate of the investment and the situation of the current interest market, a period of 1 to 3 years should be considered for a fixed deposit. Your money is not tied up too long and can be reinvested if interest rates change, or of course, used and invested otherwise.\r\n<br>Investment times that are too short usually result in a low-interest rate, which is why the profit is then comparatively low.</p><p><b>What should you pay attention to when depositing fixed deposits?</b></p><p>Due to the vast amount of offers and the different conditions of the providers, you should definitely consider comparing the options before making a deposit.\r\n<br>To points such as the amount of the minimum and maximum deposits, the interest rate, the term length, and possible account management fees You should pay particular attention to.</p>\t\t\t</div>", "author": "Ed Cobain", "date": "2020-03-18", "category": 2}}, {"model": "newspaper_app.article", "pk": 7, "fields": {"title": "The Biography Of Julian Assange.

His name is becoming the spotlight of the world because the site, Wikileaks, managed to get the secret documents the U.S. superpower. The numbers are unmitigated, i.e. the allegedly reached 250 thousand documents.

His mother, Christine, remarried to a controversial New Age movement. Julian little rarely get a formal education. even since his stepfather was very cruel, he and his mother had to flee and nomadic life. Noted he has moved the residence as much as 37 times before 14 years old. Home Schooling is not new stuff for him.</p><p>When moving up, he followed the lectures at a number of universities in Australia. In 1987, at the age of 16 years, Julian started his career in the field of computer hackers. He wears the name Mendax ' password '. Along with two other colleagues, he founded a group called International Subversives. Julian and his friends is not the destroyer program or site. They stole data from these sites are ' secret ' and distributed them to the public.</p><p>The young group has access to a number of well-known universities in Australia. Even venturing into foreign countries, one of them access to Nortel, a telecommunications company in Canada.

In the late 1970s he dropped out of Reed College in Oregon and founded Apple with his friend Steve Wozniak in 1976. He developed the concept of a fully integrated personal computer with software and hardware that Apple controlled exclusively. He was forced out of Apple in 1985 and went on to form his own company to build the NeXt computer. He then became a key player in Pixar and helped launch it as the most successful digital animation producer in the world. Apple eventually purchased Pixar.</p><p>In 1994 he returned to Apple at their invitation when the company was not doing well. What followed was one product success after another with the iMac, the iPod, iPhone, iTunes and iPad. On October 5, 2011 Jobs died of pancreatic cancer which he had struggled with for over six years. He was 56.</p><p>In addition to telling the story of Apple and Job's influence on it and its products, the book delves into his personal life and his personality. Few punches are pulled. Jobs is depicted as narcissistic and often brutal in his relationships with colleagues, friends and family. He generally put his work before everything else. His relationships with his children were often troubled. He had little contact with his first daughter, Lisa.</p><p>In 1991 he married Laurene Powell, a business student. Their marriage is described as successful though Powell had to learn to live with someone who was often difficult.</p><p>Jobs was known for being brutally honest in his work. He would declare a proposed idea or product \"shit\" and demean the people involved in it. He claimed his single aim was to assemble A class people to build A class products to serve the public in the best possible way. He had a unique ability to get the most performance out of people who respected him despite his often difficult inter-personal style. He also would lavish praise on people and their work when he liked it. People often found themselves liking him despite his rough edges.</p><p>He was famous for perfecting the \"launch\" of a new product with a carefully planned stage presentation. New products were kept secret until he unveiled them at these presentations. He was a master at public relations and marketing. He did not believe in asking the customer what they wanted. Rather, he believed it was his role to discover what the next big thing should be and then educate the public about it. He would tell them what they needed and this was almost always successful.</p><p>His artistic and design emphasis kept a focus on hardware and software that was elegantly designed. At the same time he possessed a vision of the future while paying excruciating attention to detail.</p><p>The computer industry developed along two separate tracks: the open system where software was licensed on different computers, championed by Bill Gates at Microsoft and the totally controlled and integrated model that Jobs maintained at Apple. He would rarely license any Apple software for other manufacturers. If you wanted Apple software and products you had to get them from Apple. Apple became the largest computer company and the most profitable on Job's watch.</p><p>The book does a masterful job of showing us who Steve Jobs was as a person, a CEO, a designer, visionary and businessman. He was a complex man with a genius for knowing what the public would want before they knew what they would want.</p><p>This is an outstanding book both as a biography and a study of what makes success in business.</p><p><strong>Usefulness:</strong></p><p>Reading about successful people is always useful. You can learn a lot about the importance of focus, simplicity, dedication to detail and devotion to quality from this book. You will also learn some aspects of a CEO personality which probably would not be wise to emulate.</p><p><strong>Readability/Writing Quality</strong><strong>: </strong></p><p>The book is very well written. It holds your attention and is well organized. The author juggles lots of characters and time lines well. You never feel lost.</p><p><strong>Notes on Author</strong>:</p><p>Walter Issacson is the CEO of the Aspen Institute. He has been chairman of CNN and managing editor at <em>Time</em> magazine. Issacson also wrote bestselling biographies of Benjamin Franklin, Henry Kissinger and Albert Einstein.</p><p><strong>Three Great Ideas You Can Use</strong>:</p><p>1. It is critical to maintain focus to be successful. It is as important to know what to say no to as to what to say yes to. Jobs always focused on perfecting a few products rather than being weighed down with too many.</p><p>2. Attention to detail is as important as attention to the grand vision. Jobs understood this and launched a series of high quality products that generated customer loyalty and lots of revenue. He said he was not interested in making money but in changing the world. If he made money in the process that was fine.</p><p>3. To get the most out of people you must challenge them.

She was threatened by him and then reported to police who arrested her.</p><p>This book is the story on only of the important incident that sparked significant change in race relations but also of how the woman who is the main character arrived at that situation.

She decided to join a national organization that was focused on democracy and fighting discriminatory practices.
